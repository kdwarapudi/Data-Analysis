This project completed under the guidance of my professor Ranganath Chandrashekaran. This was our final project for the course work - Healthcare Analytics. Inorder to examine
the patient behaviour over mobile communication with their doctors we divided the data into three sub-categories namely,
    1. Willingness to share information Online
    2. Mode of Communication
    3. Impact of Health Apps
Each of this was done individually by my team members in the following order : Kousalya Dwarapudi(me), Sagar Miglani and Vijetha V.

To further understand our results and how we modelled our datasets, I request you to read the pdf file!
