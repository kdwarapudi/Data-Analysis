In this project, I tried to explore the Prosper Loan Dataset which has 114k observations with 81 variables. I chose to seggregate my dataset 
and work with 17 variables and created 5 more variables from the original ones.This project also served as my introduction to ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics.The exploration is divided into 3 analytical segments in increasing order of complexity: Univariate Plots, Bivariate Plots, and Multivariate Plots, as well as a Reflection segment at the end that summarizes my experience and thoughts throughout this EDA.
