Hello fellow Data Enthusiasts,

I am Kousalya Dwarapudi. And this is my attempt to explore and make a mark in the world of data!!

Most of my work here is a culmination of various projects I have done during my Nanodegree program at Udacity {currently going-on} and some during my Healthcare Analytics coursework at UIC.
