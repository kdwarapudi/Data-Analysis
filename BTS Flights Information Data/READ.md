Summary:

I have gathered information from various websites and aggregated them into one excel file about the US Domestic Airlines and they various causes for the carrier delays.
I was set to explore the major reasons for the delay among the top 5 domestic aircrafts:
•	American Airlines
•	Delta Airlines
•	Southwest Airlines
•	United Airlines
•	Virgin Airlines
This information has been gathered over the years 2003 to 2015

Design

I have tried to use the most appropriate plots to help visualize the readers about the data I am presenting. In case someone doesn’t have enough knowledge about the states or the airports or the carriers. I have used URL actions, linking to the pages of Wikipedia.
In slide 4 where the viz talks about the average delay by carrier, I have chosen to plot that using the line chart. Since I wanted to compare the trend in delays among the top 5 domestic aircrafts in the US, I felt line charts would be appropriate there.
I have used line chart for depicting the trend in delay caused due Security, Weather and NAS clearance delays as I wanted to compare the trend among the carriers.
In slide 8, I created a new calculated field called ‘Percent of Delays’ which ratio of Arrival Delay / Arrival Flights multiplied by 100 to get the Delay percent. I did this so that we can see which flight had reached the most percentage of delays in 12 year period.
In slide 9, I tried to compare the carriers by the number of times they had been cancelled, diverted and delayed. This plot is done using the line chart to compare the trend among the 5 carriers.
Based on my first feedback, I had made the following changes to my viz
1.	I reframed the label titles so that they can help the reader understand better
2.	I removed the color scheme for world map and the carrier count bar plot as the colors don’t really signify any form of distinction
3.	I changed the color palette from Automatic to Color Blind palette
