This workbook explores various data breaches that have occured over time. Using the dataset given, I have created two calculated fields - City and
State from the location attribute. 

• You can drill down from the state map to the company name and other details via Data Breach Visuals dashboard.
• If you click on any point/marks on the state wise distribution map,from the tooltip, there is action filter – State to Company which when
clicked, will take you to the next dashboard Company wise breaches and will show you the company names and type of attack.
• Review by Year: This filter allows all the charts on the dashboard to become dynamic and show different plots by Date Made Public (YEAR) when you
click on the play button
