This project was to explore any mapdata from Open Street Map. After downloading my dataset,the file was around 731 MB which is too large for my computer to process. 
Hence, I have sampled the dataset to 83MB to carry out the data munging process. This included auditing the file, processing it and then finally loading it
into MongoDB. 
I then used PyMongo to explore my dataset and do my analysis
